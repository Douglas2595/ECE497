README for hw07

the kernel, mmap, and python scripts are all in their own files

for the kernel, you run the make file and do
    sudo insmod gpio_test.ko
it should be running then
to remove run
    sudo rmmod gpio_test.ko

for mmap, run the make file and then the executable

for python, just run
    python gpio.py

the final report with results is in Hw07_Report.dox

// Comments from Prof. Yoder
// Results look good.
